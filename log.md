# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anthony Battaglia

### Day 0: September 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1. Setup Twitter account for accountability for the 100DaysOfCode challenge. 2. Logged into Github to setup/fork this repo (learned what fork/commit are on Github). 3. Logged into FreeCodeCamp.org and found my spot in the HTML/CSS/Javascript course for continuation tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I was excited to find this challenge as it will help me be accountable for my learning progress. I also find Github extremel difficult to understand as I am new to all of this. I will be looking into a learning Github course soon!

**Link to work:** N/A?

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
