# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anthony Battaglia

### Day 0: September 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1. Setup Twitter account for accountability for the 100DaysOfCode challenge. 2. Logged into Github to setup/fork this repo (learned what fork/commit are on Github). 3. Logged into FreeCodeCamp.org and found my spot in the HTML/CSS/Javascript course for continuation tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I was excited to find this challenge as it will help me be accountable for my learning progress. I also find Github extremel difficult to understand as I am new to all of this. I will be looking into a learning Github course soon!

### Day 1: September 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began my progress on FreeCodeCamp.org in the Responsive Web Design - Applied Visual Design potion. I made progress but today's was definitely much slower than usual due to the topics covered.

**Thoughts**: 1. I learned about changing an element's positioning with different tools such as relative, absolute, fixed, and float. I was able to visually see the change or adjustment in the small browser window which helps reinforce my learning on what these do. I took notes because I am not confident I will remember how to use these as I progress in the course.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
